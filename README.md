# HW2

Hi, in this folder, I included: 
a) 3 VB codes - easy, moderate, hard
b) 3 screenshots for each year (2016,2015,2014)


The '0' chalenge: 
There were two datasets (PLNT in 2015 and 2014) that made the 'overflow' error due to the data being 0. 

My solutions:
1. In 2015, I get the open price from the first day that the open price is non-zero instead of Jan. 1. 
2. In 2014, since all the price are zero, I skiped the calculation of increase rate, and outputed "N/A".
